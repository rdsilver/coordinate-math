Coordinate Math

What happens if you use the x,y information from a pixel to determine its color?

Enter in any valid javascript using the x and y variables and press enter to see!

You can use any P5.js variables/methods as well (frameCount is a good one)

If you enter in any invalid javascript the whole thing will break! Its a feature not a bug ;) 

Examples you can try:

x ^ y + frameCount

x - y

Math.sqrt(x + y)

y | x

x* (y^2)/frameCount
